// message per frame (https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol, "Base
// Protocol"). This is the only transport LSP defines for a stdio server — no
// language-specific framing beyond this header. Reading/writing are static functions
// over plain C `FILE*` (stdin/stdout in practice) rather than a class: there is exactly
// one connection for the lifetime of this process, so there is no state to hold beyond
// the streams themselves, which the caller already owns.
//
// Ported from iris/tools/iris-lsp/JsonRpc.h — the wire format is identical, so this is
// deliberately not re-derived.
